# Configuration for type of currencies
#
# Currency Code Name: a unique name given to the currency,
# this is the currency's canonical name.
#
# Name: the display name for the currency,
# can be used for display the currency's name in chat or scoreboard, etc.
#   * Note: The plugin will use currency's canonical name if this string is empty.
#
# Prefix: the string that go before the balance of the players.
# Suffix: the string that go after the balance of the players.
# Note:
#   - Both legacy color code using "&" and MiniMessage tags "<>" are supported.
#   - The plugin does not automatically add white space after prefix and before suffix,
#     you will need to include it in the suffix and prefix string if you want spacing.
#
# Grouping: allow truncation of currency units.
#   - Value: the amount of unit each group has.
#   - Symbols: the symbol for each tier of group.
#   * Note: value lesser or equals to 0 will disable grouping,
#           if the symbols has no entry, it will also disable grouping.
#

# Will not be loaded and is view as document/comment only.
